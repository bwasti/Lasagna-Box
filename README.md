# Lasagna-Box
Digital Signal Processor from the Command Line.

# Usage

```
pip install matplotlib numpy scipy
python lbox.py cat.png
```

Try typing `rotate 10`.  To leave type `exit`.

# TODO
Think of a more convenient command line name that doesn't have capital letters and a dash in it.  Maybe "lbox"
